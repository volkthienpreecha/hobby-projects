LexIQ is a web application designed to address the widespread issue of users blindly agreeing to Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policies without understanding what they entail. These documents are typically dense, written in legal jargon, and obscure important clauses such as data selling, indefinite data storage, or forced arbitration, creating a power imbalance that undermines informed consent and individual privacy rights. LexIQ aims to bridge this gap by providing clear, plain-language summaries of ToS documents, highlighting high-risk clauses, and offering an intuitive interface where users can  r paste text for analysis. The system uses PyMuPDF to parse inputs and the OpenAI GPT-4o API to summarize policies, classify clauses by risk level (Red, Yellow, Green), and deliver an overall risk score. A clause-specific Q&A feature is implemented using LangChain or a custom prompt pipeline, enabling users to query specific terms directly. The deliverables include a functional frontend, a sample dataset of ToS documents, documentation of the model pipeline, and a final report detailing the projectâ€™s design, ethical implications, and proposed future improvements.
